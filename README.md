# STM32 Bare-Metal Libraries  

Bare-metal libraries for configuring and using peripherals on **STM32** microcontrollers without relying on HAL or CMSIS.  

## Features  
- Configuration for **GPIOs**, **UART**, **I2C**, **SPI**, **PWM**, **Timers**, etc.  
- Optimized code for **performance and low power**.  
- **No HAL** dependency for greater control and compatibility.  
- Modular approach for easier portability to different STM32 families.  
- Support for **F1, and future STM32 series**.
